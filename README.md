## Description

**YouTube Info Gather** (or **YIG**) helps you retrieve data from YouTube playlists. It can collect, save, and compare information from videos within a playlist. This is particularly useful because YouTube videos can be unexpectedly deleted, making it challenging to recover them.

The app consists of two main sections:

1. **Details Checker**: This feature allows you to obtain useful information such as the total duration of the playlist and identify hidden videos. For deleted and private videos, you can retrieve only the ID.
2. **Log Saving**: This option enables you to save a log of a playlist.

> This combination of features addresses the issue of inaccessible videos on YouTube, where users are not notified when they are removed. That's why I created this website â€“ so everyone can resolve the problem when a video is deleted or hidden, and know which one it was.

To try it out, visit **[YouTube Info Gather](https://youtubeinfogather.adamaliweb.com/)**.
