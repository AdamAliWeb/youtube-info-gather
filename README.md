## Description

This app helps you retrieve data from YouTube playlists. It can collect, save, and compare information from videos within a playlist. This is particularly useful because YouTube videos can be unexpectedly deleted, making it challenging to recover them.

The app consists of two main sections:

1. **Details Checker**: This feature allows you to obtain useful information such as the total duration of the playlist and identify hidden videos. For deleted and private videos, you can retrieve only the ID.
2. **Log Saving**: This option enables you to save a log of a playlist.

This combination of features addresses the problem of inaccessible videos on YouTube, where users are not notified when they are removed. That's why I created this website â€“ so everyone can solve that problem.

To try it out, visit **[Youtube Info Gather](https://youtubeinfogather.adamaliweb.com/)**.
